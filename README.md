# RobloxAutoCursorChanger
A simple python program that copies and pastes cursors in the roblox directory so you don't have to.
I have 4 presets right now. I might make it so you could add your own presets.
I shouldn't need to say this, but in order to use this, you do need to have python installed and how to execute a python script.
Sadly, this is only compatible with windows. MacOS support is a planned feature.
